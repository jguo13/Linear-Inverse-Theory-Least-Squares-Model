# Linear-Inverse-Theory-Least-Squares-Model
This model calculates the least squares model fit of a set of data with a guassian distribution as well as calculating the variance and covariance of the model parameters.
Included is an example set of data 'data1.dat.txt' which organized in the following way:
  1st column = x values;
  2nd column = y values;
  3rd column = error bars
